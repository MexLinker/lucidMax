brief: 



1. LiangSir: 画几个图，做几个表，弄清楚效率会比较高
图：
a. (Ai draw) system overview
you should learn a good style, both clear and beautiful
briefly explain the transformation from energy to infomation and its ability for monitoring

b. (Ai draw) the QST button structure
directly find the graph, from 
还有想问一下你你说那个QST，上次问你你说让我参考一篇论文，是哪篇？我记得你说是 liu shi qi哪篇？
（about the QST, yy: 你看我毕业论文就行）

c. (Ai draw) the difference of the push and leave for a single button
show the difference of the direction of the volatege tage, may use different color

d. (photo) the sturect of the corner 3d printed
or use the 3D view from software, you can think

e. (Ai draw) overview of the ckt
choose a right form, find out which to refer? may be the graph LiangSir drawed for charge centric

f. (Ai draw) current flow (mainly on the sensing part) of push and leave in the ckt
instead of e, try to empasis the sensing ckt, with the explaination of charge

(g+). may be can add a RC line to show the critical point of the sensing ckt
also i hvae drawed a graph from teh simulation from LTspice? PSIM?

g. (graph from instrument) the overall current consuption of pushing the button
may i can connet it to the current meter?

h. (photo) single test example, take a photo of the ckt with button


i. (photo) filed test exaple
you should try to make the result as clear as possible


表：
a. comparation of wroks
seems hard to find other similar papers, try to find a great ai agent to help me find the paper, 从我这次下载的paper中检索

b. key parameter chosen for the test
RC you chosed
the threashold of the ADC

公式：
a. E = 1/2*C*V^2

b. formula about the QST button

c. the key parameter of the RC

2. about the QST, yy: 你看我毕业论文就行


3. what is the key parameter to influence the accuracy?
