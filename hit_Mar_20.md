1.2 find out the real reson of the low impediance of the gpio to GND
1.2.1 you can test the pure PCB
1.2.2 you can test the dev board again, with different meter.
1.3 ask chatGTP, what is the meaing of the “电压跟随”?

2. the zero dynamic
2.1 implement it fine
2.2 know how to change the resistor, also as a test example. 
2.3 (also, i wont modify its serial port too soon, except my ckt cannot get the result but his can), I mean, i will use my machine as possile. 
3.4 fully understand what this ckt is doing refering to paper and pcb, may make a video

3. after having the result, i will do the lora to having a trial

4. pay attention, but smart, to not absorb to the suff the materials, but more detialed of ckt
